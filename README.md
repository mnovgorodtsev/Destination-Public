## Description

The project involved creating an application for visualizing tourism recommendations based on user preferences and advanced data processing technologies. The results were presented as a map of European regions (at the NUTS2 administrative division level), where scores were represented using a color scale. The application runs on a local server as a web-based platform. The evaluation of regions was based on multiple factors, including dynamic data such as weather forecasts and flight connections between regions. This information was stored in a database, which was deployed in a Docker container. In addition to the evaluation map, an open-source language model was implemented to help interpret the criteria used for selecting the best regions.
